# Hi there, I'm Jawwad Ahmed (RoadtoFire) 👋

### Full Stack Developer (Django & React) | Disciplined Engineering

I am a software engineer with a unique background as an Infantry Officer. I bridge the gap between **operational discipline** and **software development**. I don't just write code; I build resilient, scalable systems with a focus on meeting strict deadlines and client requirements.

Currently transitioning to full-time tech, specializing in building custom SaaS platforms and interactive web applications.
