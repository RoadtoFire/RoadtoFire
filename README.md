## About Me

I'm a **self-taught Full Stack Web Developer** passionate about building robust, scalable applications. My journey in tech has been driven by curiosity and a love for solving complex problems through code.

Currently specializing in the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), I'm actively expanding my expertise by diving deeper into backend development through Boot.dev's comprehensive computer science curriculum.

## What I'm Working On

🔭 **Currently Learning**: Advanced backend concepts, algorithms, and system design through Boot.dev  
🌱 **Exploring**: Go, Python, and distributed systems  
💡 **Building**: Full-stack applications that solve real-world problems  
🎯 **Goal**: Transitioning to backend engineering with a strong foundation in computer science fundamentals

## Tech Stack

**Frontend**
- React.js with modern hooks and context
- JavaScript (ES6+) & TypeScript
- HTML5 & CSS3, responsive design
- State management with Redux/Context API

**Backend**
- Node.js & Express.js
- RESTful API design and development
- MongoDB & Mongoose ODM
- Authentication & authorization (JWT, OAuth)

**Tools & Technologies**
- Git & GitHub for version control
- Docker for containerization
- AWS/Heroku for deployment
- Postman for API testing

## My Learning Philosophy

As a self-taught developer, I believe in **learning by building**. Every project teaches me something new, whether it's a better way to structure code, a more efficient algorithm, or a deeper understanding of user experience. My Boot.dev journey is strengthening my computer science fundamentals, helping me write more efficient code and tackle complex backend challenges.
